JavaScript Canvas Wolfenstein 3D Raycaster
Author: Andrew Lim
https://github.com/andrew-lim/html5-raycast

Adapted from this article by Jacob Seidelin
http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/creating-pseudo-3d-games-with-html-5-can-1/

Main differences from the original:
- Use <canvas> elements to render the game. In the original article <div> and <img> strips
  were used to render the walls, floor and ceiings.
- Player rotation is now stored as unit circle radians. In other words, turning left counterclockwise
  is a positive angle.
- Wall size is now 128 game units. The player's position in a tile is no longer a floating point
  value between 0 to 1, but an integer between 0 to 128.
